# Crazy-Pong

A small, web‑based Pong clone with a few extra features:

* **Fireworks** whenever a point is scored
* **Tactical AI** – the computer predicts where the next ball will hit its paddle
* **Multiple balls** (up to 5) and a **random giant ball** (3× bigger) that gives 10 points
* **Player control** via the arrow keys:
  * `↑` / `↓` – move the paddle up / down
  * `←` – move the paddle a little bit back (half speed)
  * `→` – move the paddle forward to the middle line (full speed)
